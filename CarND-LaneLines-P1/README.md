**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

There are 7 steps in my pipeline
 1. Transfer RGB image to Grayscale image.
 2. Apply Gaussian Blur on Grayscale image.
 3. Apply Canny edge-detection on Blurred image.
 4. Mask the region that outside the current line.
 5. Use Hough transform to the masked Canny-edged image. and 
 6. Use draw_line() function to draw lines.
 7. Overlay line on image.

I modify draw_line() in following way:
 1. average all right lane slopes to get a mean slope.
 2. average all right lane x and y points that I can have a point can be used to calculate intercept of a line.
 3. Use this line to draw a line from the bottom of imgae to far point.

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

I tested my code on Optional Challenge video, the result is not good. 2 lines intersect at far point, and the slopes of 2 lines are not correct.

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

For the test image and 2 test 2 video, my results are ok for those test case. But it could have error on some of more curvy lane, or a narrow. My improvement will be keeping tuning some parameters specially the threshold , min_line_length and max_line_gap, and modify my draw_line() function using the same far point to draw right lane and left lane. Finally, I will implement the algorithm from suggest to improve my code.
